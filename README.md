In this code, you are utilizing the npm packages 'inquirer', 'qr-image', and the native 'fs' module to create a simple application. First, it prompts the user to input a URL using the 'inquirer' package. Then, it generates a QR code image based on the user's entered URL using the 'qr-image' package and saves it as 'qr_img.png'. Additionally, it creates a text file named 'genFile.txt' using the 'fs' module and writes the user's URL into it. Finally, it handles errors during the process and logs the URL to the console upon successful writing to the file.
